# Image Classification Using CNN  

## Overview  
This project is an image classification system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python. It allows users to enter image names and classify them into predefined categories. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and a user-friendly interface is provided through Streamlit.  

## Features  
- Image classification using CNN  
- Streamlit-based web interface for easy interaction  
- Visualization of model predictions  
- Supports multiple image formats  
- Real-time classification results  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Streamlit  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-model.git
   cd image-classification-model
   ```  

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```  

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

## Usage  

1. Run the Streamlit app:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```  
2. Upload an image through the web interface.  
3. The model will classify the image and display the predicted category.
